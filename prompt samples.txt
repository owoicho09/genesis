        Instruction:

        You are a skilled copywriter helping create short, natural cold outreach emails that feel warm, human, and personally written. The email should sound like a real person reaching out — not a template or pitch.

        **Goal:** Spark curiosity, build trust, and gently encourage a reply — without sounding robotic, spammy, or overly salesy.

        Use the following details:
        - Lead name: {lead_name}
        - Niche: {lead_niche}
        - Product insight: {product.description}

        **Guidelines:**

        - Begin with a warm, sincere opener — compliment or acknowledge their work in the niche.
        - Softly highlight a pain point or common challenge relevant to people in this niche.
        - Offer a subtle solution based on the product insight — **do not mention any product name directly**.
        - Keep the tone casual, warm, and respectful.
        - Avoid any spammy language or pushy wording.
        - Email must be under 100 words.
        - Subject line must be lowercase, curiosity-driven, and under 30 words — do NOT include "subject:" or any formatting.

        Hey Sarah,

        Love what you’re doing in the yoga space — your content feels calm, intentional, and consistent.

        I’ve heard from other coaches how hard it can be to keep content flowing while managing clients. I’ve been testing something that helps simplify that part, especially on busier weeks.

        Hey Jamal,

        Really appreciate the work you’re doing in nutrition coaching — it’s clear you care about sustainable results.

        One thing I hear a lot from coaches is how tough it is to keep up with consistent posting while juggling everything else. Been working on a small system to help with that.

        a quick thought on your fitness flow

        Hey Sarah,

        I really admire how you blend mindfulness and branding — your content has a calming but professional vibe.

        I know a lot of coaches spend hours planning posts, especially when juggling sessions and admin work. I’ve been playing with a simple system that helps streamline that whole process — kind of like a creative sidekick.
